# 🚀 Crypto Strategy Backtester

A modular cryptocurrency trading strategy research framework built in Python.

This project allows traders and developers to develop, test and compare multiple trading strategies on historical cryptocurrency data before deploying them to live markets.

Unlike a simple moving average crossover project, this repository includes multiple trading strategies, market regime detection, crash testing, multi-asset evaluation and live signal generation.
